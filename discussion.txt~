2.3 Experiments and discussion.

(1). How might you improve the classification accuracy of the Gaussian mixtures, 
without adding more training data?

For improving the classification accuracy of the Gaussian mixtures,
(a) when the value of max_iter becomes greater, we gain the better accuracy of Gaussian mixtures .




(2). When would your classifier decide that a given test utterance comes from 
none of the trained speaker models, and how would your classifier come to this decision?






(3). Can you think of some alternative methods for doing speaker identification
 that donâ€™t use Gaussian mixtures?
